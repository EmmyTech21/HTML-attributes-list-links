        <h2>TOURISM IN ALGARVE REGION</h2>

    <p>It was here that, in the 15th century, the Portuguese set off on the epic journey that led them to discover other peoples and cultures… and it is in
         the Algarve that we cheerfully welcome many of our visitors. Even the climate is mild and sunny all year round</p>

         <p>
            There's no shortage of high quality beaches either. Sandy stretches as far as the eye can see, framed by golden cliffs, virtually deserted islands marking the boundary between Ria Formosa and the sea, and small coves
             sheltered by the rocks. The ocean, in every shade of blue and mostly calm and warm, 
             invites you for long swims and to indulge in water sports</p>
             <p>And there are also the mountains, where people live in harmony with nature and maintain traditions that they love to share. And the cities. Silves preserves traces of its Arab past and Lagos from the time of the Discoveries. More cosmopolitan Portimão and Albufeira are bustling towns by night and day. Tavira is a showcase for traditional architecture and Faro, the gateway to the region, deserves a long stop to discover its beautiful historic centre.

                To relax, you can have various treatments in the spas and thalassotherapy centres and in the Monchique Thermal Baths. There are also many internationally acclaimed golf courses where you can enjoy a spot of exercise. And hotels,
                 tourist villages, resorts, from the simplest to the most sophisticated.
                  In short, a varied array sharing a genuine love for hospitality.</p>
